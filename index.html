        <h2>The Usual Suspects: Common Pests We Deal With</h2>
        <p><strong>Ants:</strong> These tiny guys always seem to know when you’ve left out a crumb or two. Before you know
            it, they’ve sent in the whole troop. Our team can locate the source and eliminate it swiftly.</p>
        <p><strong>Mice and Rats:</strong> When you hear that little squeak or find chewed-up food packaging, you know
            you’ve got a problem. These rodents not only make a mess, but they can also bring diseases into your home.
            Let us handle them before they take over.</p>
        <p><strong>Cockroaches:</strong> Cockroaches have been around for millions of years and for a good reason—they’re
            tough. But don’t worry, we’re tougher. We’ll ensure they’re gone before they multiply.</p>
        <p><strong>Bed Bugs:</strong> These little monsters love to make themselves at home in your bed. Waking up with
            itchy bites is never fun, but we can get rid of them so you can sleep peacefully again.</p>
        <p><strong>Wasps and Bees:</strong> While they’re essential for the ecosystem, no one wants to deal with a wasp
            nest near their house. We handle these buzzing pests with care and professionalism.</p>
